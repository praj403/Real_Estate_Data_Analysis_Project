As we all know Data science is spreading towards different domains. Similarly real estate & housing is our actual domain which we are working.

We are trying to understand that the present application with the same domain needs to be updated and to be added to different modules which data science can answer. So, here we are using same 99acres data to understand and deliver the best to our business
